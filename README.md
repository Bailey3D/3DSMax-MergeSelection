# Merge Selection for 3DS Max

Merge Selection is a tool for simply merging all objects currently selected.
It takes the process of merging down from `Set Selection -> Edit Mode -> Find Attach Button -> Attach` to just `Set Selection -> Merge Selection`.
This can save a tonne of time when working with many selections.
The tool currently works on Geometry and Splines.


## Installing:

Unzip the file to any desired location on your hard drive
In the 3DS Max menus, go to `Scripting -> Run Script` and find the `install.py` script (in the root folder for the tool).



## Running the Scripts (GUI):

To run the scripts in GUI mode, in 3DS max go to `Scripting -> Run Script` and find the `merge_selection_gui.ms` script (in the root folder for the tool).
This will launch a separate tool with interfaces for all 4 scripts. Just click the one you want and that's it!


## Assigning Hotkeys:

Macros are generated for quick running of all available scripts, including the GUI.

To assign a hotkey, in 3DS Max go to `Customize -> Hotkey Editor` and choose the category `Bailey3D`. From there you should see macros for:
